<p><font size=+1>Virgo provides multiple windows, each for managing a separate
part of the program. The main window must always be active, while all other
windows can be enabled/disabled as convenient. All windows are enabled
by default, except the memory window which consumes a big part of the system
resources and should be enabled only when running Virgo on a powerful machine.</font>
<p><font size=+1>When you first load Virgo, only the main window appears
and most options are disabled. After you load an OBJ file, other windows
appear, and they are automatically lined up in a neat way. You can customize
the number, location, and size of the your windows. If you want to restore
the default appearance, choose <i>Arrange neatly</i> from the <i>Windows</i>
menu. You can also choose <i>Close all</i> from the <i>Windows</i> menu
to close all windows (except the main window) at once.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Below is a brief description of every window:</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>The main window</font>
<blockquote><font size=+1>Contains all the features you need to manage
OBJ files and run/debug your code. It also contains a black area that serves
as a simulated <a href="../../p86/devices/screen.html">P86 screen</a>.</font>
<br><font size=+1><a href="The main window.html">More details</a>.</font></blockquote>
<font size=+1>The registers and ports window</font>
<blockquote><font size=+1>Contains fields that enable you to view all P86
registers, flags, and ports. In this window, you can modify the contents
of registers, flags, but you can't mess with ports.</font>

<font size=+1>The code window</font>
<blockquote><font size=+1>Contains all the information about your code,
including the address of every instruction in memory, labels given to certain
instruction, and the assembly source for every instruction. There is a
checkbox beside every instruction, that serves as a breakpoint indicator.</font>

<font size=+1>The memory window</font>
<blockquote><font size=+1>Shows you the contents of every memory cell in

the contents of any cell by double clicking on it. This window is not open
by default. Read the first paragraph in this documemt for details.</font>
