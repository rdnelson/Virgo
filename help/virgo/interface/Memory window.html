<p><font size=+1>The memory window enables you to view the contents of
all memory cells at once. It is a very helpful tool. However, it devours
your system resources so that performance will degrade considerably if
this window is open. That's why this window is omitted by default. If you
believe in the power of the machine you're running Virgo on, you can always
enable the memory window:</font>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1>In the <a href="The main window.html">main window</a>, select
the <i>windows</i> menu.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>check the checkbox that reads "<i>memory window enabled</i>"</font></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<font size=+1>Once the memory window is enabled, you will notice a difference
in Virgo's performance. To disable this window, simply close it.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Every memory address consists of four hex digits. The
most significant three are listed as row entries in the first column titled
"<i>Address</i>". The least significant hex digit is used as a column title.
For example, to read the value of the memory cell 003A, look in the row
that starts with <i>003</i>, under the column titled <i>A. (See the figure
above)</i></font>
<p><font size=+1>The memory window also enables you to modify the contents
of any memory cell. Double click on the desired cell and a dialog will
appear asking you to enter the new value. The new value must be a valid
hexadecimal byte or else it will be ignored.</font>
