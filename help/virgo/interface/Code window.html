<p><font size=+1>This window shows you details about the code that your
<a href="../../assembly/The OBJ file.html">OBJ
file</a> contains. Every row corresponds to one <a href="../../assembly/About assembly.html">assembly</a>
instruction in your source code (which you originally wrote in you <a href="../../assembly/The ASM file.html">ASM
file</a>).</font>
<p><font size=+1>You can select an instruction by clicking in the appropriate
row. The selected instruction is outlined in blue.</font>
<p><font size=+1>One of the instructions is higlighted in red. This tells
you which instruction is the current instruction. The current instruction
is the instruction that IP currently points to. You can't specify which
instruction is the current one, unless you manually set the value of IP
in the <a href="Registers and ports window.html">registers and ports window</a>.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Every row contains four entries:</font>
<p><font size=+1>Breakpoint indicator:</font>
<blockquote><font size=+1>This checkbox indicates whether this instruction
is a <a href="../breakpoints/What is a breakpoint.html">breakpoint</a>
or not. Double click it to set/reset a breakpoint. You can also set breakpoints
in the <a href="Breakpoints window.html">breakpoints window</a>.</font></blockquote>
<font size=+1>Start address:</font>
<blockquote><font size=+1>This field contains the memory address where
the first byte of the instruction is stored.</font></blockquote>
<font size=+1>Label:</font>
<blockquote><font size=+1>This field contains the label that you gave for
the instruction (if any). If your source code gives multiple labels for
the same instruction, only one of them is displayed.</font></blockquote>
<font size=+1>Source code:</font>
<blockquote><font size=+1>This field contains the assembly code associated
with the instruction, along with any comments that appeared in you ASM
file.</font></blockquote>
