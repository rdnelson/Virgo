<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+2>Modifying the system
state</font></font>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></center>

<p><font size=+1>Virgo simulates a simple machine (called <a href="../introduction/What is P86.html">P86</a>)
and shows you how your code modifies the state of that machine. Ideally,
the only way to change the state of that machine is through the instructions
in your code. However, to help you experiment with the computer machine,
and get the feel of how it behaves, Virgo allows you to manually change
the state of the machine (eg. registers, flags, memory)</font>
<p><font size=+1>Virgo only allows you to modify things while your program
is idle. That is, you can't manually change anything while your program
your running. If you want to, <a href="breakpoints/Managing breakpoints.html">set
a breakpoint</a> (or press pause at the right split second), modify as
needed, then run again.</font>
<p><font size=+1>If you end up modifying the state too much!, you can always
press the reset button in the <a href="interface/The main window.html">main
window</a>. This will reload your instructions and reset the system to
its initial state.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<font size=+1>Modifying registers:</font></h2>

<blockquote><font size=+1>In the <a href="interface/Registers and ports window.html">registers
and ports window</a>, every register is represented by a button that carries
its value. Press on a button to change the value of a specific register.
The new value has to be a valid hexadecimal word (4 hex digits) or else
the new entry won't be accepted. If you try to change the value of IP,
the new value has to correspond to the starting address of some instruction
of your code, otherwise it will be considered invalid. Note that changing
the FLAGS register might automatically change the system flags as well.</font></blockquote>

<h2>
<font size=+1>Modifying flags:</font></h2>

<blockquote><font size=+1>In the <a href="interface/Registers and ports window.html">registers
and ports window</a>, flags are represented by check boxes. If a flag is
checked, it means that it is <i>set</i>, i.e equal to one. click on any
flag to <i>set</i>/<i>reset</i> its state. Note that modifying a flag will
automatically change the value of the FLAGS register.</font></blockquote>

<h2>
<font size=+1>Modifying ports:</font></h2>

<blockquote><font size=+1>Virgo does not allow you to modify the values
of ports manually, mainly because ports are not persistent containers.
That is, unlike memory cells, ports are not there to hold information,
but to interact with the devices connected to the computer system. The
only way to read/write a port is using the IN/OUT instructions respectively.</font></blockquote>

<h2>
<font size=+1>Modifying memory cells:</font></h2>

<blockquote><font size=+1>In the <a href="interface/Memory window.html">memory
window</a>, every memory location is represented as a separate cell. Double
click on any cell to change its value. The new value has to be a valid
hexadecimal byte or else it won't be accepted. You can't change the value
of a word (2 bytes) at once. To do that, change the value of every byte
separately (little endian!). Also note that if you modify the part of memory
that contains your byte code, I can <font color="#FF0000">GUARANTEE</font>
you that your code won't work any more!</font></blockquote>
