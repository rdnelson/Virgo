<p><font size=+1>Here is a list of the error messages that Virgo might
decide to shoot at you for one reason or another. The messages are arranged
by the task you were trying to perform when they occured. Every message
has its explanation beside it, along with some suggestions about what might
be the problem:</font>
<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%"></h1>

<h1>
<font size=+1>When opening OBJ files:</font></h1>
<u><font size=+1><i>filename</i> does not exist or is unreachable</font></u>
<blockquote><font size=+1>The file you wanted to open was not found. Either
you typed the name of a file that does not exist (check for spelling errors),
or you do not have read access to the file that you specified (consult
network administrator).</font></blockquote>
<u><font size=+1><i>filename</i> is corrupted</font></u>
<blockquote><font size=+1>The file that you tried to open in not a valid
OBJ file. It contains bad data inside it. Try re-assembling your original
ASM file.</font></blockquote>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h1>
<font size=+1>When debugging your program:</font></h1>
<u><font size=+1>End of code is already reached</font></u>
<blockquote><font size=+1>The last time you executed the program, a HLT
instruction was reached. This is the end of the program and you can't run
your code any further! If you want to run your code from the start again,
press <i>Reset</i> in the <a href="interface/The main window.html">main
window</a>.</font></blockquote>

<p><br><u><font size=+1>Instruction set IP to a location that is not the
start of an instruction</font></u>
<blockquote><font size=+1>After executing an instruction, IP ended up pointing
to a location that does not correspond to the start of any insturction
in your code. This means something went wrong for sure! I suggest you look
for the following pitfalls:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1>You ended your code but forgot to add a HLT instruction at
the end</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>Your PUSH/POP pairs do not match (especially during subroutine
CALLs)</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>You did not set up the vector table CORRECTLY prior to calling
a software interrupt (using INT)</font></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<u><font size=+1>The first byte in the instruction does not confirm to
any known instruction</font></u>
<br><font size=+1>or</font>
<br><u><font size=+1>Bad REG field ....</font></u>
<br><font size=+1>or</font>
<br><u><font size=+1>Instruction contains an invalid address mode</font></u>
<blockquote><font size=+1>One of the instructions does not follow the standard
instruction-encoding format. Chances are, in some previous instructions
you have modified some memory locations that contain your code. Make sure
that all instructions that modify memory modify the RIGHT locations.</font></blockquote>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h1>
<font size=+1>When modifying the system state:</font></h1>
<u><font size=+1><i>x</i> is not a hexadecimal byte/word!</font></u>
<blockquote><font size=+1>You are trying to modify a register or a memory
cell, but the new value you enter is not valid. A register must contain
a valid HEXADECIMAL word. A memory address must contain a valid HEXADECIMAL
byte. If you don't understand the meaning of those sentences, ask your
instructor.</font></blockquote>
<u><font size=+1>New IP does not point to the start of an instruction!</font></u>
<blockquote><font size=+1>You are trying to modify register IP. This register
contains the memory address of the next instruction to be executed. The
new value that you want IP to contain does not confirm to the start of
any instruction in memory. Look at the table in the <a href="interface/Code window.html">code
window</a> to see the start address of every instruction in your code.</font></blockquote>
