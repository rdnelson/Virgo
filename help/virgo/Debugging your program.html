<hr WIDTH="100%"></center>

<p><font size=+1>Virgo provides multiple running modes that help you debug
your program, ranging from executing one instruction at a time, to running
the whole program at once.</font>
<p><a NAME="singleStep"></a><img SRC="../images/singlestep.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20><font size=+1>
Single step:</font>
<blockquote><font size=+1>Executes a single assembly instruction (<a href="#The current instruction">the
current instruction</a>) and immediately modifies the state of the machine.
This mode is useful when you have pin-pointed the troublesome spot in your
code and want to take a closer look.</font></blockquote>
<a NAME="stepOver"></a><img SRC="../images/stepover.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20><font size=+1>
Step over:</font>
<blockquote><font size=+1>Behaves exactly like single step. Except that
if <a href="#The current instruction">the current instruction</a> is a
CALL or INT, the whole subroutine that is called is executed. This mode
is useful if you're single stepping and you come across a CALL that you
know is not the cause of any problems (eg. CALL displayText or INT 4).</font></blockquote>
<a NAME="run"></a><img SRC="../images/play.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=18><font size=+1>
Run (or play):</font>
<blockquote><font size=+1>Sequentially executes the instructions in your
code, starting at <a href="#The current instruction">the current instruction</a>.
Running will stop when any of the following happens:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1>The end of code is reached (HLT instruction)</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>A <a href="breakpoints/What is a breakpoint.html">breakpoint</a>
is reached</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>An invalid instruction is reached</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>IP is set to a value that is not the start of an instruction</font></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="runUntilCursor"></a><img SRC="../images/untilcursor.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20><font size=+1>
Run until selected code line:</font>
<blockquote><font size=+1>Behaves exactly like <a href="#run">run</a>,
except that execution will also stop when the currently selected code line
is reached. You can think of this mode as a Run with a temporary breakpoint.</font></blockquote>
<a NAME="runUntilCall"></a><img SRC="../images/untilcall.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20><font size=+1>
Run until CALL:</font>
<blockquote><font size=+1>Behaves exactly like <a href="#run">run</a>,
except that execution will also stop when the first CALL instruction is
reached.</font></blockquote>
<font size=+1>To make debugging even more efficient. Make use of Virgo's
<a href="breakpoints/What is a breakpoint.html">breakpoints</a>
and <a href="watches/What is a watch.html">watches</a>.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="The current instruction"></a><img SRC="../images/tip.gif" NOSAVE height=11 width=11><font size=+1>
Note:</font>
<blockquote><font size=+1><font color="#FF0000">The current instruction</font>
is the instruction that IP currently points to. In the code window, you
will find this instruction highlighted in red. To change the current instruction,
you can change the value of IP in the registers and ports window.</font></blockquote>
