<p><font size=+1>A watch is probe that enables you to monitor changes in
a specific location in memory.</font>
<p><font size=+1>For example, let's say your program places important information
at memory address 223AH, and let's say that you need to know what that
memory cell contains at all times during execution. Instead of enabling
the <a href="../interface/Memory window.html">memory window</a> and watching
the changes to that specific cell, you can tell the debugger that this
memory cell is critical and therefore needs a <i>watch</i> to be placed
on it. This watch will then appear in a separate window, telling you the
value of that memory cell at all times.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Virgo allows you to watch as many memory locations as
you want. You can watch individual bytes, words, or pre-defined variables.
There is a separate window for watches called <a href="../interface/Watches window.html">the
watches window</a>. For details about managing watches <a href="Managing watches.html">follow
